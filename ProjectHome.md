# What is a meipi? #

A meipi is a collaborative space where users can upload information and content around a map. Each meipi has a particular context, which can be local (when the entries are related to a specific area), or thematic (when the content is associated with a particular idea).

# How can a meipi be useful? #

A meipi allows a group of users to share information around a place or a topic. It can be very useful for collaborative dynamics, workshops, associations, enterprises, groups of friends, artistic actions...

In meipi.org we already have a tool to create and host user meipis. This open source package can be used to install a meipi in your own server.

We have created a [group](http://groups.google.es/group/meipi) where we all can discuss about the project. Feel free to join! :-)
